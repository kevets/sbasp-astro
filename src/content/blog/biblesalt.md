The sources specifically indicate that **salt** had a known use in the formation of covenants within the context of the Old Testament.

### Salt Used in Forming Covenants

In the larger context of biblical instruction and practice, salt is referenced directly in relation to establishing or confirming covenants:

*   Salt was used **"in forming covenants"**.
*   The reference supporting this historical use points to the book of Leviticus (Leviticus 2:13).
*   A "covenant of salt" is mentioned in the context of the dedication of the priesthood to God (Numbers 18:19).
*   The concept of the **"covenant of salt"** also appears in connection with the covenant established with David's dynasty (2 Chronicles 13:5).

### The Larger Context of Salt

Beyond its role in covenants, the sources mention other functions and symbolic uses of salt, often emphasizing its positive, enduring, or protective qualities:

**1. Purification and Preservation:**
Salt was used for **"cleansing and preservation from decay"**. This use is referenced in Ezekiel 16:4.

**2. Flavor and Purpose:**
Salt was used for **flavor** (Job 6:6; Mark 9:50). Jesus drew on this common understanding to instruct his disciples:
*   He declared to his followers, **"You are the salt of the earth"**.
*   This statement emphasizes that the disciples' lives should have a **"profoundly positive effects on the world around them"**.
*   Jesus gave a corresponding **warning** about maintaining this role: if salt has **"lost its flavor,"** it is considered **"worthless"** and will be **"thrown out and trampled under foot"**. This warns disciples against doing anything that might **"jeopardize that positive impact"**.

**3. Maintaining Integrity (Metaphorical Application):**
In the broader teachings of Jesus, the preservation property of salt is linked to the conduct required of his followers, who are called to a surpassing righteousness. The requirement for his disciples is to exhibit behavior that conforms to Godâ€™s will.
